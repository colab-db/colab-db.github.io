 EvoProtGrad is a Python package for directed evolution of proteins in sequence space with gradients. 

Compose a custom protein model that maps sequence to function with  pretrained models, including protein language models (PLMs), to guide and constrain search. Natively integrates with ðŸ¤— HuggingFace transformers. The MCMC sampler identifies promising amino acids to mutate via model gradients taken with respect to the input (i.e., sensitivity analysis).

Use this colab to demo the sampler. Input a protein sequence and output a population of variants.
